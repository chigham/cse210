This is the solution that I wrote from scratch. You should run the dice_game.py file. The dice and game classes are in dice_game_classes.py and are referenced.

The game class functions similarly to the Director class from the template. It doesn't appear to have bugs, but it also is not as pretty code.

For example, the game class has fewer methods. It also contains multiple loops and conditionals like an ugly standalone script. I did not even name it correctly ('Game' would be a best practice name).

This game gives nice feedback and handles bad input. Like I said, it looks completely different from the template, but does pretty much the same thing.
